There is no formal support from the University of Washington Computational Hydrology Group for the RVIC model.  For users interested in using or contributing to the RVIC model, we recommend using the [UW-Hydro/RVIC Github issues page](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/RVIC/issues) to interact with the RVIC development team.
